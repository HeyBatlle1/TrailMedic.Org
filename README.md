## 🚨 Emergency Use Case

*"You're 20 miles into a backcountry hike when your partner falls 20 feet down a cliff. They're conscious but reporting severe leg pain, numbness in their toes, and you can see obvious deformity in their wrist. No cell service. No professional medical help for hours. What do you do?"*

**TrailMedic provides instant, AI-powered medical assessment and step-by-step emergency protocols specifically designed for wilderness survival situations.**
